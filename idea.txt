== AspectPHP ==

AspectPHP adds Aspect Oriented Programming features to PHP.
It allows hooking into most of the class methods that are not provided by the PHP Core.

=== Concept ===

AspectPHP uses a custom stream wrapper to hook into the class loading process.
It injects extension points and allows the registration of handler objects
that are invoked when the method of the source object is called.
